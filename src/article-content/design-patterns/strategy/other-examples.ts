      <li>&#183 Sorting list with different strategies. <code>Collections.sort(list, Collections.reverseOrder());</code></li>
      <li>&#183 Zipping a file using different zipping techniques.</li>
      <li>&#183 Storing content to DB, XML or CSV</li>
      <li>&#183 A taxi service charging a customer based on the time of the day. Day charges and night charges.</li>
      </ul>`,
